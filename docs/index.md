Javascript is the dominant programming language in web development. Initially, its designed for the web element interaction in web pages. Javascript engine in browser will take care of js code execution in client side. But modern JS can run also in server side (most popular one is nodejs) which makes the javascript as one of the powerful programing language in modern web application development

## **History of Javascript**

* **`Brendan Eich`** - Javascript was developed by Netscape developer named Brendan Eich. First name is mocha, then it renamed as Livescript and finally changed to Javascript due to the fame of java at that time
* **`JavaScript 1.0`** - JavaScript 1.0 was released on 1996 by Netscape
* **`JavaScript 1.1 - ECMAScript 1(ES1)`** - JavaScript 1.1 was released on 1997, with new features like general-purpose, cross-platform, and vendor-neutral scripting language and became an ECMA standard
* **`ECMAScript 2(ES2)`** - ES2 was released on 1998 with editorial changes
* **`ECMAScript 3(ES3)`** - ES3 was released on 1999 with new features like regular expressions, try/catch, switch and do-while
* **`ECMAScript 4(ES4)`** - ES4 was not released
* **`ECMAScript 5(ES5)`** - ES5 was released on 2009 with new features like Json support, Array iteration methods, strict mode etc..
* **`ECMAScript 2015(ES6)`** - ECMAScript 2015 was released on 2015 with new features like let/const, default parameters values and array find index functionalities
* **`ECMAScript 2016(ES6)`** - ECMAScript 2016 was released on 2016 with new features like 
exponential operators and array include functionality
* **`ECMAScript 2017(ES6)`** - ECMAScript 2017 was released on 2017 with new features like 
string padding, object entries, object values, async and shared memory functionalities
* **`ECMAScript 2018(ES6)`** - ECMAScript 2018 was released on 2018 with new features like 
rest/spread properties, asynchronous iteration, promise finally and RegExp

## **Where we can use javascript?**

* **`Web Development - Frontend`** - React Js, Vue.Js and Angular are very popular Javascript frontend framework for client side programming
* **`Web Development - Backend`** - Node Js, Express Js and Meteor Js are very popular Javascript backend framework for server side programming
* **`Game Development`** - Easel Js is a rich graphics javascript library which helps to develop games on the web
* **`Mobile Application`** - React Native, Ionic, Titanium, Jquery mobile are very popular javascript framework for hybrid mobile app development
* **`Desktop Application`** - Electron Js helps to build the cross platform desktop apps using javascript
* **`Machine Learning`** - Tensorflow Js library helps to build the ML Models and Neuro js is an another JavaScript framework for develop reinforcement learning and deep learning models

## **Characteristics of Javascript**

* **`Light Weight Scripting Language`** - Light weight is one of the best feature of js since its developed mainly for client-side execution
* **`Dynamic Typing`** - Similar to python, Js also support dynamic typing which means that the declaration of variable data type is not mandatory
* **`Objected Oriented`** - From ES6, object oriented programming concepts has introduced in Javascript. Through which, developers can implement all the OOPS concepts like class, object, encapsulation, inheritance etc..
* **`Platform Independent`** - Java script supports write once run anywhere concepts. Same code can use in multiple platform without any impact in its output
* **`Interpreted Language`** - Javascript codes are usually interpreted by js interpreter to process the code. But, engine like V8 in chrome are follow just in time compilation to execute javascript code
* **`Async Processing`** - Javascript facilitates async processing which means, it won't wait for the response once request get initiated. Parallel execution will happens and reduce the overall script execution time
